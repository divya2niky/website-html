        <h2>I am senior at BYU studying CS. I will be graduating in April 2023. I am excited for my graduation and everything that is ahead this year.
        </h2>
        <p>
          I am from India. I started to show interest in coding while I was working in India. I got an chance to collaborate with the Research and Development team,
          that's when I realised to shift my career. After a long wait, I was able to get into BYU. I love everything about this school and the opportunites it created for me. 
          I have been involved in many different projects at BYU. I currently working on an mentorship app that will allow students to easily and quickly connect 
          mentees(students) with mentors. The connections will often target a specific issue that someone needs mentoring help with. 
          
        </p>
        <p>
          I love teaching myself new things. 
          The most important thing for me is working well with others, especially when it comes to creating something new or solving problems with my classmates.
          Other than coding and school, I like to run. I did a couple of half marathons and participated in a mid mountain marathon at park city.

          of projects in a high-quality, 100% responsive design instantaneously in a single platform that helps them save time and reduce costs. 
          It enables the users to show the audience their expertise, learnings, and experiences to help expand their network or increase their brand presence.
          Key features of my start up are:
          1. Secure login over HTTPS
          2. Ability to select the options Home, About, Projects, Contact, Settings and Dark/light mode
          3. Display of choices
          4. Ability to download the resume
          5. Ability to send a message directly 
          6. Ability to access the github repo for the projects
